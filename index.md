## Advanced Techniques on Regression and Experimental Design
This is the collection of my notes on Advanced Techniques on Regression and Experimental Design. 
We will focus on some techniques that are even more advanced than UA STAT 571A and UA STAT 571B. So I preassume that you have good knowledge of single and multiple linear regression modelling, diagnotics, remedying as well as basic type of experiment like RCBD, Factorial Design, Nested Design and Split-plot Design.

Here're a list of topics we'll cover: 

Part I  Advanced Diagnotics Techniques 

Topic 1. Influential analysis 

Topic 2. Measurement error and IV 

Topic 3. WLS and Robust regression

Topic 4. Cross validation and model selection

Topic 5. Correlated error

Part II  Advanced Regression Models

Topic 1. ANCOVA

Topic 2. PLS

Topic 3. GLM

Topic 4. Multivariate Multiple Regression

Topic 5. Semiparametric Regression

Part III  Advanced Experimental Methods

Topic 1. Response Surface Experiments and Designs

Topic 2. Design for Linear Regression with Correlated Errors

Topic 3. Regular and Multistratum Fractional Factorial Designs

Topic 4. Structures Defned by Factors

Topic 5. Algebraic Method in Experimental Design

Part IV  Optimality and Robustness

Topic 1. Designs for Selected Nonlinear Models

Topic 2. Designs for Generalized Linear Models 

Topic 3. Optimal Design for Spatial Models

Topic 4. Latin Hypercubes and Space-Filling Designs

Topic 5. Design for Sensitivity Analysis

Topic 6. Robustness of Design

Topic 7. Algorithmic Searches for Optimal Designs
